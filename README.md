```

No framework, no bundler. The site is a single `index.html` (~88 KB) with embedded CSS + JS.
Capacitor wraps that same `index.html` into native iOS and Android apps.

## Design system

- **Palette:** Cream (`#FBF5EC`) + electric coral (`#FF4D1F`) + mint (`#00B584`). Inky-black ink. Full dark mode (`#0F0D0A` background).
- **Type:** Fraunces (display, variable axes — uses `SOFT` + `WONK`), Inter (body), JetBrains Mono (labels).
- **Layout:** Top nav + scrolling ticker. Big serif hero. Section-paneled content. IntersectionObserver-driven scroll reveals.
- **Responsive:** Phone → tablet → laptop → 4K TV. Container scales up to 1920px on TV-class screens; type fluids via `clamp()`.

## Running locally

```bash
# 1. Install deps (only needed for native builds)
npm install

# 2. Serve the site locally (any port)
npm run dev          # → http://localhost:5173
# or just open index.html in a browser
```

## Native apps — iOS + Android via Capacitor

> The `android/` and `ios/` folders are already scaffolded and committed.
> You only need to install deps + `pod install` on a Mac to build the iOS app.

### How it's wired

- `index.html`, `manifest.json`, `sw.js`, `icons/` live at the **repo root** (so Vercel can serve them as a static site).
- `npm run build` runs `scripts/build-www.mjs`, which mirrors those files into `www/`.
- Capacitor's `webDir` is set to `www`, so `npx cap sync` copies from there into the native projects (`android/app/src/main/assets/public/` and `ios/App/App/public/`).

### Every time you change web code

```bash
npm run cap:sync     # = build-www + cap sync (refreshes both platforms)
```

### Regenerating icons & splash screens

Source assets live in `assets/` (1024×1024 icon + 2732×2732 splash, light + dark). After editing those:

```bash
npx capacitor-assets generate --android --ios \
  --iconBackgroundColor "#FF4D1F" \
  --iconBackgroundColorDark "#0F0D0A" \
  --splashBackgroundColor "#FBF5EC" \
  --splashBackgroundColorDark "#0F0D0A"
```

This regenerates all 56 Android + 7 iOS icon/splash assets.

### iOS build & submit (App Store)

```bash
# One-time, on macOS:
cd ios/App
pod install
cd ../..
npx cap open ios         # opens Xcode
```

In Xcode:
1. Select the **App** target → Signing & Capabilities → set your **Team** (needs Apple Developer account, $99/yr)
2. Bundle ID is preset to `com.anchittandon.portfolio` — change in `capacitor.config.json` if needed
3. Bump version + build number under General → Identity
4. **Product → Archive** → upload to App Store Connect
5. Submit for review at [appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)

**⚠️ Apple Review caveat:** Apple often rejects portfolio sites wrapped as apps under Guideline **4.2 — Minimum Functionality**. To strengthen the case:
- The PWA layer adds offline mode + share target + app shortcuts ✓
- Consider adding native features before submitting: push notifications, Siri shortcuts, share extensions, or a "contact me" haptic
- Write a clear App Review note explaining how it differs from the website (e.g. offline access, native share, home-screen presence)

### Android build & submit (Play Store)

```bash
npx cap open android     # opens Android Studio
```

In Android Studio:
1. Wait for Gradle sync
2. **Build → Generate Signed Bundle / APK** → create a keystore (save it safely — you need it for every future update)
3. Sign with your keystore → produces a `.aab` file
4. Upload to [play.google.com/console](https://play.google.com/console) (needs Google Play account, $25 one-time)
5. Fill out store listing → submit for review

Google's review is faster and more lenient than Apple's. PWA-style wrappers are generally fine.

### What you'll need

| Platform | Required | Cost |
|----------|----------|------|
| iOS | macOS + Xcode + Apple Developer | $99/yr |
| Android | Android Studio (any OS) + Google Play Console | $25 one-time |
| App icons | Already generated in `icons/` | — |
| Splash screen | `icons/splash-2048x2732.png` (regenerate at higher resolution if needed) | — |

## Web deploy (Vercel)

See [`DEPLOY.md`](./DEPLOY.md). TL;DR:

```bash
vercel
```
